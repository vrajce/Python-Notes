# Variables and data type
**Variable** is the container for storing data and one particular type of data can be stored is called datatype. for example if some jar is storing sprouted chanaa and mug
then it's datatype will be cereal.

now , python is soo smart that we don't need to specify the datatype while declaring the variable .
eg 
```
a = 2352
```
like above , a is the variable of integer type autodetected by python.
now to know the datatype explict , we can use **type()** funtion.

```
a = 3443
print(type(a))

```
