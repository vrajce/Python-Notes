# Comments Escape Sequence and Print Statement
1) **Comments** :- Comments are the sentence that does not execute , it is basically used to show information about code , author , or any new thing.

   Single line comment
   ```
       # this is comment and any line can be comment by putting # at starting of line
       print("hello world",56)
       print(5)

  Multi-line comment
   ```
       # this is comment and any line can be comment by putting # at starting of line
       print("hello world",56)
       print(5)  
 
       '''
       This is multi-line comment by triple single quotes and comment inside them
       '''
  ```
3) **Escape Sequence** :- to insert the character that can not be directly inserted in the string

   for eg : - if we want to print any string with double quotes included but if we do like this

   ```
   print("Hell0 "world ", my self vraj")
   ```

   this will create a syntax error as the opening bracket is always in search for closing bracket which indicates the end of string and as soon as it finding the double
   quote of world it creates error

   so to show world in double quotes ("World") we need to use escape sequence and can be used by backslash(\)

   for eg :-
   ```
   print("Hell0 \"world \", my self vraj")
   ```

   now escape seqence is also a character only .

   *for new line* :-
   ```
   print("hello world \n",56)
   ```
   the above code will print hello world on line one then new line because of "\n" used

   *for tab space*:-
   ```
   print("vraj\tparmar\tvraj")
   ```
