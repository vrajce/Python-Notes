# Comments Escape Sequence and Print Statement
1) **Comments** :- Comments are the sentence that does not execute , it is basically used to show information about code , author , or any new thing.

   Single line comment
   ```
       # this is comment and any line can be comment by putting # at starting of line
       print("hello world",56)
       print(5)

  Multi-line comment
   ```
       # this is comment and any line can be comment by putting # at starting of line
       print("hello world",56)
       print(5)  
 
       '''
       This is multi-line comment by triple single quotes and comment inside them
       '''
  ```
3) **Escape Sequence** :- to insert the character that can not be directly inserted in the string

   for eg : - if we want to print any string with double quotes included but if we do like this

   ```
   print("Hell0 "world ", my self vraj")
   ```

   this will create a syntax error as the opening bracket is always in search for closing bracket which indicates the end of string and as soon as it finding the double
   quote of world it creates error

   so to show world in double quotes ("World") we need to use escape sequence and can be used by backslash(\)

   for eg :-
   ```
   print("Hell0 \"world \", my self vraj")
   ```

   now escape seqence is also a character only .

   *for new line* :-
   ```
   print("hello world \n",56)
   ```
   the above code will print hello world on line one then new line because of "\n" used

   *for tab space*:-
   ```
   print("vraj\tparmar\tvraj")
   ```

   **3) print statement**
as we have seen the use use of print statement and also how to print diff-diff data in single print statement
now the diff datas are seperated by space but if we want o seperate it using same character/string and it can be done by using sep keyword

let's see an example:- 
```
print("hell",4,43,4,44,sep="vraj" )
```

output:-
```
hellvraj4vraj43vraj4vraj44
```

now like sep keyword we also have end keyword which will add some string defined by user at very end of string and if print statements has many parameters then the string will be added at very last.

it's like *takiya kalam* like yk people add some statement after each and every sentence it's like that only (**eg:- chuna laaga ke ðŸ˜‚**)

for eg:-

```
print("hell",4,43,4,44,end="vraj\n")

```

output:- 
```
hell 4 43 4 44vraj
```
