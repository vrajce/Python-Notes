# String
Anything unclosed in the double quotes("_") becomes string.

eg:- 
```
name = "Vraj"
print(name)
```

Output:- 
```
Vraj
```
so name is the string with Value "Vraj".

now , the string is the characater array and in array we know that their is concept of indexing and the indexing starts with 0 so , at 0 index thier is 'V' , then at 1 their is 'r' and so on..

soo,
```
name1 = "vrh"
print(name1[0])
print(name1[1])
print(name1[2])
```

output:-

```
v
r
h
```

now, if try to access the index that does not exists , then it will generate error.

```
name1 = "vrh"
print(name1[0])
print(name1[1])
print(name1[2])
print(name1[3])
```

Output:- 

```
v
r
h
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "c:\Users\Vraj\OneDrive\ドキュメント\Coding\python\hello.py", line 111, in <module>      
    print(name1[3])
          ~~~~~^^^
IndexError: string index out of range
```

Now , if we want to print that is unsual means the string contains extra spaces , new lines 

name = "fbtrb
fgnh
gnfgn
gnf"

So , the above string will give error , to make the above string valid we have to use triple quotes to unclose it.

eg:-

```
name = """fbtrb
fgnh
gnfgn
gnf"""
print(name)
```

Output:- 

```
fbtrb
fgnh
gnfgn
gnf
```

now to access the string character-by-character then we can use for loop

eg:-

```
name = """fbtrb
fgnh
gnfgn
gnf"""

for ch in name:
  print(ch)
```

Output:- 
```
f
b
t
r
b


f
g
n
h


g
n
f
g
n


g
n
f
```
