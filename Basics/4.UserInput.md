# Input from the user.
Their is the input function which helps us to take input from the user and assign it to some variable.
it will be always a string input from the user.

Let's see a example: 

```
a = input("Enter value for a")
b = input("Enter value for b")
print(a,b)
```
All the inputs will be treated as string.

Now , here when we enter the 2 interger value and then try to add to add it then it will perform **String concatenation**

eg:-

```
# if a = 5 , b = 5
a = input("Enter value for a")
b = input("Enter value for b")

sum = a + b
print(sum)

```

Output:-

```
55
```

Now if we want to do addition or perform any other operation on the above 2 a and b.
then need to do **type casting**.
```
a = input()

b = input()

print(type(a) , type(b))

sum =  int(a) + int(b)

print(sum)
```
